# Dynamical Network Biomarkers and Graph Attention Network for Early NSCLC Diagnosis

## Project Overview
### This project introduces an innovative model for non-invasive early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Combining Dynamical Network Biomarkers (DNB) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), the model integrates miRNA biomarkers and clinical data, enhancing the ability to provide early warnings for high-risk pre-cancer states and improving diagnostic accuracy.
